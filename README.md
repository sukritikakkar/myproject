# Python project on student stress and GPA prediction
This data analysis project explores how different lifestyle factors such as sleep,study time and extracurricular activities affect academic performance and stress levels.
# Objectives
- Study the correlation between different lifestyle factors in context of GPA and Stress Level.
- Predict GPA using Linear Regression
- Predict Stress Level using Logistic Regression

# Dataset Overview
- 2000 student records with no missing or null values
- Features: Sleep Hours, Study Hours, Physical Activity Hours,Extracurricular Activities Hours,Social Hours,GPA and Stress Level(High,Moderate,Low)

# Tools & Technologies
- Python: pandas,seaborn,matplotlib,sci-kit learn
- Jupyter Notebook

# Key Findings
- GPA is strongly correlated with study hours(+0.73)
- Stress and GPA both increase with study hours while decrease with sleep and exercise
- GPA and Stress are moderately related(+0.55)
- While the trend is as stated above, there are exceptions as seen in boxplots where students with low stress have higher GPA than students with high stress
- Logistic Regression achieved 86% accuracy for stress level prediction

# Project Status
Complete: Explanatory Data Analysis, Modeling, Evaluation.
