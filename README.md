# 🧠 Student Stress and GPA Prediction

This data analysis project explores how various lifestyle factors such as sleep, study time, and physical activity influence student GPA and stress levels. The project uses machine learning models to predict both GPA and stress levels based on behavior patterns.

## 📌 Objectives
- Analyze the correlation between lifestyle habits and academic performance
- Predict GPA using Linear Regression
- Predict Stress Level using Logistic Regression

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- 2000 student records with no missing or null values
- Features include:
  - Sleep Hours
  - Study Hours
  - Physical Activity Hours
  - Extracurricular Activities
  - Social Hours
  - GPA
  - Stress Level (High, Moderate, Low)

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Insights
- GPA is strongly correlated with study hours (**+0.73**)
- Stress and GPA both increase with study hours, and decrease with sleep and physical activity
- GPA and Stress Level are moderately correlated (**+0.55**)
- Boxplots reveal some students with low stress and high GPA — exceptions to the general trend
- Logistic Regression achieved **86% accuracy** in predicting stress levels
